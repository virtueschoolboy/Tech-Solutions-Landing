# Tech-Solutions-Landing
A simple, professional landing page for a mock IT firm in Nigeria.

This is a practice project where I tried to build a real-world business page for a tech company called 'TechSolutions.' I focused on making it look clean and professional, the kind of site a Nigerian startup would actually use. It helped me practice using CSS to organize different sections like services and contact info.
